Bookstore Management System with Authentication and Authorization, including roles (user, admin), using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), along with Tailwind CSS for styling and DesUI (a UI kit) is a comprehensive project. Here's a structured approach to creating this system:

Key Features:
Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and have role-based access (user/admin).
Authorization: Admins can manage books, while regular users can view books and make purchases.
Admin Panel: Admins can add, update, and delete books, manage users, and see order history.
Books and Users Schema: MongoDB will store information about users and books.
Responsive UI: Tailwind CSS for responsive design and DesUI for pre-built components.
High-Level Architecture
Backend:

Node.js with Express for handling API requests.
MongoDB for storing books and user data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
Bcrypt.js for password hashing.
Frontend:

React.js for dynamic UI.
Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
DesUI for UI components like buttons, forms, etc.
